# the-open-data-science-bootcamp

## Introduction:

This work is an outgrowth of an intensive self-study program in data science and machine learning. The goal is to maintain a collection of tools, illustrative coding samples, and learning resources to augment a formal or self-directed data science 'bootcamp experience.' Enjoy!

** Note: Efforts have been made to include as much open source content as possible. Feel free to suggest alternatives to paid content, where comparable alternatives exist.
